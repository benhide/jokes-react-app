You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm install`

To install dependencies.

### `npm run build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

### `Tech Stack:`

- TypeScript - Static type checking / interfaces / type guards (pattern).
- React - Declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux - Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
- Redux Toolkit - Opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
- Axios - Javascript library used to make HTTP requests.
- React Router - Declarative routing for React.
- Create-react-app - Boiler plating react app project files and dependencies.

- ESLint - Linting
- Prettier - Formatting

### `Notes:`

- Strongly typed all properties, variables and objects. This includes strongly typed API requests.
- Redux thunk actions for async api calls (fetching data).
- Basic CSS styling for component styling.
- Functional components used, using react hooks.
- Routing used for declarative routing.

### `Improvements:`

In the next update the following will be implemented:

- Use material UI for component styling.
- Post joke page (with joke submission validation) for posting jokes to api.
